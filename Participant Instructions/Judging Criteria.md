Welcome to the Polyverse Judging Criteria. This guide outlines the key factors that will be considered when evaluating submissions. Our goal is to ensure a fair, transparent, and comprehensive assessment of all projects.

### Overview of Judging Criteria
- **Project complete and open**: Evaluates the project's readiness for community use, openness to contributions, licensing clarity, and future development roadmap.
- **Code Quality**: Assesses the use of current libs/standards/frameworks, adherence to coding standards, code clarity, maintenance practices, and error handling.
- **UI**: Judges the intuitiveness, completeness, and guidance provided by the user interface, whether CLI or GUI.
- **Community value and documentation**: Measures the project's engagement with the community, quality of documentation, and efforts to facilitate contributions.
- **Wow factor**: Gauges the project's innovation, potential for integration, and contribution to enhancing the developer experience.

## Scoring Rubric

| Criteria |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Project completion and openness |Code implements sufficient features for a functional MVP that community can interact with. The code is open source and properly licensed. We believe in community collaboration and licensing is permissive, how to contribute clear and open-sourced code  makes contribution easy. Further development path or potential roadmap is defined. |Code is a viable MVP but not ready to use for community. The project indicates it is open to contributions, but lacks clear guidelines, making it difficult for contributors to understand how to contribute effectively. Licensing is clear. | Implementation is incomplete and lacks a clear development path to provide an MVP. Licensing isn’t clear or source code is closed preventing community development to MVP. |
|Code Quality |Programming language and code dependencies utilise current versions. The code demonstrates high quality, with clear adherence to best practices in coding standards, style, and conventions. Code is commented and project includes tests and CI showing a commitment to release and maintenance of quality software. Reused code libraries are from sources with active maintainers and user communities. Error handling and consideration of fallbacks. |Programming language and code dependencies utilise current versions. The code is well-organized, adhering to standard coding conventions and styles. Comments and documentation within the code are helpful and facilitate understanding. Errors handling is in place.|Project demonstrates significant reuse of existing code (e.g. a project fork) without code additions that represent a significant contribution to  code or development effort.  codebase is functional but lacks consistency in style, with minimal comments, making it difficult to read and maintain. Reused libraries lack active maintenance or user community. |
|UI|CLI user prompts and -help is clear and give intuitive guidance on usage to the first-time user. If a GUI is provided, design style is concise without unnecessary verbosity.|UI is complete and intuitive to use. Basic help documentation is comprehensive, providing clear instructions on using the CLI, but may lack examples or detailed descriptions for more complex commands.|UI is incomplete, prompts non-intuitive and hard to follow. Commands and options are limited, and there is little to no guidance or help documentation available for users, making it challenging to use without prior knowledge.|
|Community value and documentation|The project further demonstrates exceptional community engagement, with regular updates, activity in discussion forums, community events, and offer a clear, welcoming space for other contributions. Explainer video to help community get up to speed with implementation. |The project boasts comprehensive documentation, including detailed guides, tutorials, and examples that cater to various user levels.|The project has minimal documentation and community engagement. There's little evidence of effort to involve the community.|
|Wow factor|The project significantly enhances the developer experience with innovative features and tooling. It demonstrates high potential for reusability and integration into other projects. |Project extends or builds on the feature coverage provided by existing tooling. Project contributes to improving developer experience.|Project adds no or little new functionality to that provided by existing tooling or a reused some other tool codebase.|

Please note that there might be a significant delay between the submission deadline and the evaluation of projects. Therefore, the leaderboard will remain hidden (in stealth mode) until its official release.
